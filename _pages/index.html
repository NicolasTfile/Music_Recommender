        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for this project came mainly from our love for music. There's nothing quite like discovering a new song that instantly becomes a favorite. Music recommendations can come from various sources, but many music apps are known for compromising user data and prioritizing ads over music discovery.</p>
        <p>With Music Recommender, we set out to create a user-centric platform that rekindles the joy of finding amazing music. Our project promises an immersive experience, putting the user's musical journey first.</p>
        <p>This project was developed as part of Holberton School's portfolio projects. Feel free to connect with our team members on LinkedIn, explore our GitHub repository, and follow us on Twitter.</p>
